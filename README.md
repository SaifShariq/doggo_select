# DoggoSelect
Instead of using external JavaScript libraries, We are using fetch api, A data fetching interface that is native to the browser.
To experiment using the fetch api, a simple dog search application named "DoggoSelect" is created. The dogs are searched according to their breeds and while selected, can view various images of the dog breed selected just by clicking on the image shown.
There is also a name and comment option included. To make this work a fake API database was used just for the project purpose.
